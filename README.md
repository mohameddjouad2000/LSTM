# Energy Consumption Prediction with LSTM

This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict momentary energy consumption based on time series data. The dataset includes various features related to energy signals the code supports experiments with different model configurations like Multivariate input, Univariate input 
the key steps include data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, and feature correlation weighting), sequence creation for LSTM input, model training, and performance evaluation using metrics like MSE, MAE, and RMSE.
